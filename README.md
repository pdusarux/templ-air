# TEMPL-AIR 🚀

TEMPL-AIR is a blog-style website built with Go, Gin, and templ, featuring live reloading capabilities using Air. This project is inspired by and based on the Urchin CMS project by [@matheusgomes28](https://github.com/matheusgomes28/urchin).

## Features 🌟

- **Go-Powered Backend**: Utilizes the efficiency and performance of Go for server-side operations.
- **Gin Web Framework**: Employs Gin for routing and handling HTTP requests.

- **Live Reloading**: Implements Air for hot-reloading during development.
